                            <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The strength of an idea<br>
                It all began with a bench on Corso Re Umberto, one of the most famous streets in city centre Turin.<br>

                A group of friends congregated on this bench. They all possessed a shared passion for football, a special game that had recently been ‘imported’ from England. They had an intriguing idea, to create a sports club. The boys attended the ‘Massimo D’Azeglio’ high school which specialised in classical studies. They were well educated but the eldest was just 17 years of age. This paved the way for the club’s name. In Latin, the name ‘Juventus’ means youth. They weren’t aware of it yet, but on 1 November 1897, they had given birth to a legend... SWIPE!</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class='slider-panel'>
                        <h3></h3>
                            <p>And so Italy’s greatest football team was born, almost by chance. The club’s first President was Enrico Canfari, the first ground was Piazza d’Armi (Parade Ground) and the side started out wearing pink. Sporting that same jersey, the club made its debut in the national championship in 1900. Three years later, the Bianconeri colours, which had come from Nottingham, were in use. Five years later, the first Italian title arrived when Juve successfully beat off stiff competition from Genoa and Milanese. President AlfredoDick from Switzerland, left the club shortly afterwards following various complaints and rifts in the dressing room. He then went on to found Torino FC, bringing the best foreign players from Juventus with him. Juventus then endured some difficult years as they failed to keep pace with the new footballing superpowers of the time, Pro Vercelli and Casale.</p>

                                <h3></h3>
                            <p>
                                Juventus resumed their success after the Second World War. Following the tragic death of Edoardo Agnelli in a plane crash in 1935, his son, Giovanni, took on the role of president in 1947. The club’s most revered champions at the time were Carlo Parola, Danish duo John Hansen and Praest and, most notable of all, Giampiero Boniperti. Cheered on by thousands of fans, they recorded Scudetto triumphs in 1950and 1952.<br>
                                In 1953, Giovanni Agnelli stepped down from the presidency and it was then passed onto his brother Umberto two years later. Juve were on the brink of another triumphant cycle. The arrivals of Omar Sivoriand John Charles helped the Bianconeri to the Scudetto title in 1958 which allowed them to wear a star on their shirts to mark ten national championship victories. The club recorded three further successes during the 1960s, with the last coming in 1967 under the presidency of Vittore Catella.

                    <h3>Un calcio al razzismo</h3>
                        <p>
                            Juventus has been constantly engaged in the fight against racism through various local and international initiatives. “Un calcio al Razzismo” is an example of a concrete initiative, born in 2009, through which Juventus and the UNESCO Centre in Torino express their commitment in promoting the values of sport and in offering tangible support to young people involved in the fight against racism.  Un Calcio Al Razzismo, now at its 7th edition, contributes, with 5000 EURO per year, to projects, implemented either by young people between 18 and 25, or by NGOs, whose aim is to fight racism or any other form of discrimination.

                <h3>Education and Integration</h3>
                <p>
                    For several years now, Juventus has been organising special training activities for children and teenagers, from “Gioca con Me” to the several projects of the J|Academy that seek to combine sports with education as a way to help each single child grow as a person. All projects have clear underlying values such as respect for teamwork, spirit of sacrifice and education.<br>
                    Juventus condemns any kind of discrimination and with the help of UNESCO, over the past few years it has succeeded in giving shape to this unflinching commitment.
